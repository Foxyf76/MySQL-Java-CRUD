This is a simple JavaFX application to connect to a localhost MySQL server, where it can perform basic CRUD operations. 
This is achieved using the MySQL Connector Library for Java.

## Installation

Since JavaFX is no longer bundled with newer JDKs (JDK 11 onwards), it is necessary to download and specify the JavaFX SDK manually.
Find the download link [__HERE__](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).

Setup guides for both Eclipse and IntelliJ can be found at: https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/
