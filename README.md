## Information

This is a simple JavaFX application to connect to a localhost MySQL server, where it can perform basic CRUD operations. 
This is achieved using the MySQL Connector Library for Java.

## Installation

The necessary project files are already included for both IntelliJ and Eclipse. However, since JavaFX is no longer bundled
with newer JDKs (JDK 11 onwards), it is necessary to download and specify the JavaFX SDK manually.
Find the download link [__HERE__](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).

Setup guides for both Eclipse and IntelliJ can be found at: https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/
